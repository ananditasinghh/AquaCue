# AquaCue

AquaCue is a plant care management project that is designed to provide timely reminders and guidance for watering plants. The project aims to assist users in effectively managing their plant watering routines and ensuring optimal plant health. This project is coded in C++.

The main intuition to code this project came from my personal gardening experience. As the saying goes, "Plants die when we don't water them," which is a well-known fact among gardeners. However, what many people may not realize is that plants can also suffer if we over-water them. Additionally, the timing and frequency of watering play a crucial role in a plant's growth and development, varying at different stages of their life cycle.
During the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in gardening and gain firsthand experience. It was during this time that I truly grasped the importance of understanding the unique requirements of different plant species. I witnessed how their growth could be affected by inadequate or excessive watering, and how critical it is to strike the right balance. This project aims to bridge the knowledge gap and equip gardening enthusiasts with the tools they need to nurture and maintain healthy and thriving plants :)

This project utilizes a user-friendly interface that allows users to input information about their plants, including the plant's name, watering schedule, and specific water requirements. The system maintains a database of plants set(of about 31) and their corresponding watering needs. And accordingly it recommends the users the ideal time to water plants.

The key features of this project are :

1. Personalized Watering Reminders: AquaCue provides customized reminders for watering plants based on individual plant needs, watering schedules, and environmental factors. This feature helps users maintain consistent and 
   appropriate watering routines, promoting plant health and growth.
2. Plant Database: AquaCue includes a comprehensive plant database that stores information about various plant species, their specific water requirements, and other relevant details. 
3. Optimal Watering Recommendations: The project offers recommendations for optimal watering frequencies and durations based on factors like plant species, weather conditions, and soil moisture levels.
4. User-Friendly Interface: AquaCue features a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to input plant information, set watering schedules, and receive reminders.
